# SMS-Spam-binary-classification
in this project, we use deep learning algorithm names Convolutional neural network to classify sms as spam or ham. This project aims to be perform well by using better data preprocessing algorithm appropriate for spam detection content. Now we are trying to read more works in this domain, for performing our work by taking more perspectives listed.
We putted data into spam folder.
For this work, we pretrained a word2vec algorithm, that will help we to convert text into numerical vector. Each sms is considered as a matrix of words converted.
We pass that matrix into part of convolution to extract better characteristic of message. these chacarteristics are passed into a fully connected netword for spam or non-spam classification.
